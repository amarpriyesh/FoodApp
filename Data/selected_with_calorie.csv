If you are using active dry yeast (look like small round balls) - follow the instructions given in the packet.If you are using fast action yeast (looks more like fine semolina) then in a large bowl combine the flours, salt and sugar and gradually add in the yeast and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, adding little flour if it tends to get sticky. Once all of the ingredients form a ball; add the olive oil and place the ball on a work surface and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes. Repeated kneading combines all the ingredients well and will help the bread rise well in the oven.Once you have finished kneading and gained enough arm muscle; place the dough in a large bowl coated with olive oil and cover it with cling wrap/plastic wrap and allow it to rise for about 2 hours.After two hours you will notice that the dough has doubled. At this point punch the dough down and knead gently. Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth and let them sit for another 30 minutes.While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 250 C. The oven should be preheated for at least half an hour before you can bake the pitas in them. Now it should be time to work your dough into flat bread. Take one ball, dust it with a little flour and dust the work surface as well. Using a rolling pin, roll the pita into an oval or a circle. Make sure the pitas are thin; about 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thick. Continue the same with the remaining dough balls.Place the rolled portion of pita bread on dusted baking sheets and place it inside the oven. Bake the pita dough until they puff - you will see them rising forming bubbles, to slowly puffing and fully puffing up.The whole process takes a maximum or 3-5 minutes and not more than 5 minutes. If the pita bread does not rise in 5 minutes, then take them out. The Pita Bread will still be cooked, but just wont have pockets and will still taste just as good.You can serve Whole Wheat Pita Bread Recipe along with soups or make it into sandwiches like Egg Bhurji Stuffed Pita Pockets Recipe, Aloo Tikki Stuffed Pita Sandwich Recipe, Pita Sandwich With Cauliflower Falafel And Roasted Vegetables Recipe and more.

Blend them together briefly.Next, in a large measuring cup, measure 1 cup lukewarm milk. To this add honey, butter and whisk together. Sprinkle the yeast over the milk and allow it to get frothy for about 3-4 minutes.If using a food processor/stand mixer; with the food processor/stand mixer running on low speed, gradually pour the milk mixture into the processor over the flour.Slowly add in the water (as much required) and allow the flour to form a soft dough within the bowl of the processor/mixer.If using a mixing bowl; add the frothy yeast and milk mixture to the flour and begin to knead with your hands.Add water gradually, only as much as needed and keep kneading it till the flour forms a soft and pliable dough.Take care not to add too much water or you will have a sticky unmanageable dough.Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead again for 8-10 minutes, working the dough very well, until it is smooth and elastic. (If using the stand mixer, knead on medium speed using the dough hook)Transfer the formed dough to a lightly greased bowl, turning once to coat all over. Cover with a wet kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set it aside in a warm place for about 1 - 1 1/2 hours until it has risen and doubled in size.Meanwhile, mix together the butter, chocolate chips, raisins and orange zest. Grease and line a baking sheet or a tray with parchment paper and set it aside for later use.Once the dough has doubled, dust a working surface again with flour and gently roll the dough into a rough 9x12 inch rectangle on it.Spread the butter chocolate chip raisin mixture evenly on top of the rolled out dough.Then, starting with the longer end, roll the dough up into a scroll, making sure to keep it tight so the filling remains inside.Use a sharp knife to cut the log into 1 inch rounds. Place the individual rounds on the prepared sheet, cut side down.Cover the sheet with a wet kitchen towel and allow the rolls to rise a second time, for about 30 minutes.Meanwhile, set your oven to preheat at 200 degrees C.When the rolls have risen for 30 minutes, reduce the heat to 180 degrees C, sprinkle the rolls with granulated sugar and place them to bake until they are are golden brown.Remove the Chocolate Chip and Raisin Rolls from the oven, allow them to rest for 5-10 minutes.Serve Chocolate Chip & Raisin Rolls along with your evening masala chai or as an after school snack.",http://www.archanaskitchen.com/chocolate-chip-and-raisin-rolls-recipe,371.0

Lift the dough carefully from the floured surface and place it in a 9 inch tart pan with a removable base.Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly; press the edges into the sides of the pan. It is important to press the dough evenly into every nook and corner of the pan's ring. Remove the excess dough that is hanging off the sides of the pan. Place the tart crust in the freezer for atleast another 15 minutes. This process of chilling the crust, helps make the crust flaky when baked.Prebaking the Tart CrustPreheat the oven to 180 C. Once the oven is preheated, Prick the chilled tart crust with a fork, so it does not puff up while in the oven. Cover the tart crust with foil, place pie weights or beans on the crust and prebake the crust for about 25 minutes. The tart will look golden brown but not completely baked. Remove the tart crust from the oven and allow the oven to be on at 180C.Remove the foil and pie weights/ beans and keep the crust aside while we prepare the filling.Method for Chocolate FillingWhisk the eggs in a bowl until light and flully. Keep aside.To make the chocolate filling for the tart, place the heavy cream and milk in a sauce pan over medium heat, add in the chopped chocolate and keep stirring on low heat till you see the chocolate melting half way through. Turn off the heat and proceed to melt the chocolate into the milk and cream mixture in the existing heat. Add in the sugar and salt and whisk the chocolate cream mixture until well combined.Next add in the whisked eggs into the chocolate cream mixture and whisk it in well until well combined. The chocolate cream filling mixture is now ready to be poured into the tart crust.Pour the filling into the tart crust and place it back into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy. If you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away as this indicates that the tart is getting overbaked.Keep monitoring the Chocolate Tart while its in the oven, as the baking times differ from oven to oven. It is important to monitor so you don't over bake the chocolate.Remove the Chocolate Tart from the oven, and allow it to cool completely. Refrigerate the Chocolate Tart for about 8 hours until set and serve it along with fresh fruits, like strawberries.Serve the Chocolate Tart Recipe as a Dessert for a Get together Party to amuse your guest.
","We begin making the Chocolate Tart Recipe by following the below procedures:Method for making the tart crustIn a large mixing bowl; combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the butter and mix the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add in a tablespoon of ice water at a time and knead to bring the flour together.Knead to form a firm dough that is firm and does not break apart when you try to press it. Make sure you only add a tablespoon of water at a time, as the warmth of your hand will help bring the flour together to form a dough. Wrap the pastry crust dough in cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface.

Or make idlis from idli batter in idli steamer and keep aside for 1-2 hours or more. Cut each idli into 6-7 pieces.Heat a shallow fry pan and add a teaspoon of oil and spread evenly.Place 6-8 pieces of idli at the bottom of the pan and shallow fry for a few minutes until crisp.The idli pieces will turn brown and crunchy at the base. This is one way of making crunchy idli pieces. I prefer making the crispy idli pieces this way. The other way (easier way) is shallow fry whole idlis until they turn light brown.Then cut these idlis into 6-7 pieces. Now, heat another pan, with a wide base. Add the remaining oil.  Once the oil is heated, add chopped onions and fry until it turns crispy. Add the chopped capsicum pieces and fry well.Add the ginger paste and mix well.  Add to the above mix, add soy sauce, red chilli powder and salt.  Add slit green chillies and saute well. Put off the heat and sprinkle oregano flakes and mix.

Cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring constantly, or until the strawberries become soft and mushy, and have released their juices.Add in the sugar and cornstarch stir vigorously to avoid forming lumps.  Continue to cook - and stir - for another 1-2 minutes. Remove pan from heat when the mixture thickens up and transfer the filling into a small bowl. Set aside.*To make the dough:In a pan, add the milk and heat on low flame for 1 minute until it becomes lukewarm. Turn off the flame. Now add a pinch of sugar and yeast to the lukewarm milk and stir it for few seconds. Keep aside undisturbed for 10 minutes or until froth appears on top of the milk. While adding the yeast to the milk, ensure that your milk is lukewarm and not hot, because if it is hot then chances are that your yeast will die.In a separate bowl, add sugar, egg, salt, melted butter, and the milk-yeast mixture. Whisk until all ingredients are well combined.Start adding the flour, 1/3rd at a time, and gently mix it with a spatula. Mix well, until a thick, sticky dough forms and all the flour is incorporated.Dump the dough on a well-floured surface and knead just until the dough is no longer sticky and forms a ball.This will take about 10-15 minutes.Alternatively you can even knead the dough in a food processor .Place the dough into a greased bowl. Put little bit oil on top of the dough, cover the bowl with a wet muslin cloth or a towel and allow the dough to rise at a warm place for at least an hour or until doubled in size.*To make the rolls:Once the dough has risen, put it on a lightly floured surface and gently squish the dough ball with your hands to make a rectangular shape. Now using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough while maintaining the rectangular shape. Roll it to a size of about 14 X 6"" rectangle.Now spread the cooled strawberry filling on the rolled out dough leaving about 1/2 inch border. On top of the strawberry filling, spread the grated chocolate.Start making the roll by rolling from the long side. (You have to roll length wise). Now using a serrated knife, cut out about 8 rolls and place them in a greased baking pan.Cover the pan with a wet muslin cloth or a towel and place it at a warm place to rise for about 45 minutes or until the rolls have doubled up in size.Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven at 180°C for about 25 minutes or until they become golden brown.Once your rolls are baked, remove them from the baking pan while they are still warm.

In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt. Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour.Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.Next we will divide the dough into 14 to 16 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you the feeling ready.While the dough is resting, lets prepare the filling for the parathas. I am going to be using homemade paneer as it makes the parathas softer, but you can use store bought paneer as well.In a large bowl; add in the homemade paneer. Use your fingers or a fork and begin to crumble the cottage cheese. Next add in 1 large chopped onion, lots of chopped methi leaves, finely chopped green chillies, cumin powder, and salt. Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 10 to 12 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around. Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the paratha. Once sealed press down the paneer paratha with your palms to release any air pockets. And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out. Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a paneer methi paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around the paneer paratha.Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the paneer parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the paneer paratha is cooked transfer to a plate. Continue to the remaining dough portions the same way.Serve the Stuffed Paneer Methi Paratha Recipe along with a Raita for a wholesome breakfast or dinner.
","To begin making the Paneer Methi Paratha Recipe, we will first need to make the dough for the parathas. In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt. Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour.Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky.Next we will divide the dough into 14 to 16 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you the feeling ready.While the dough is resting, lets prepare the filling for the parathas. I am going to be using homemade paneer as it makes the parathas softer, but you can use store bought paneer as well.In a large bowl; add in the homemade paneer. Use your fingers or a fork and begin to crumble the cottage cheese. Next add in 1 large chopped onion, lots of chopped methi leaves, finely chopped green chillies, cumin powder, and salt. Combine all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into 10 to 12 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.Take a paratha dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface. Place this rolled dough to the side.Take another dough portion, dust it with flour again and roll into approximately 3 inch diameter circle.Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and spread it evenly around. Next, take the other rolled portion of the dough and place it over the filling.Press and fold the edges so that the filling does not come out while cooking the paratha. Once sealed press down the paneer paratha with your palms to release any air pockets. And give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out. Proceed the same way with the remaining paratha dough and filling portions.Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a paneer methi paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough.Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around the paneer paratha.Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the paneer parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the paneer paratha is cooked transfer to a plate. Continue to the remaining dough portions the same way.Serve the Stuffed Paneer Methi Paratha Recipe along with a Raita for a wholesome breakfast or dinner.",http://www.archanaskitchen.com/paneer-methi-paratha-recipe,230.0

The level of water should be an inch above the rice in the bowl. Let it soak for about 6 hours or overnight. Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water. The level of water should be 2 inches above the dal in the bowl. Let it soak for about 6 hours.After the soaking period, first grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very smooth batter. The batter will look fluffy.Grind the rice, ragi, barley into a smooth batter, adding just the required amount of water to grind into an almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the mixture too watery. If required grind a little at a time to get a  smooth batter .Combine the urad and rice ragi batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the ragi idli dosa batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the Homemade Ragi Idli & Dosa Batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.*To make the Mushroom Filling:Into a preheated pan, heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan. Add the onions, garlic and green chillies and saute until the onions become soft and lightly caramelized.Once the onions have softened, add the tomatoes and saute until it becomes mushy.
